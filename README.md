## About The Project
We developed an online music creation platform with digital instrumentation and sound synthesis. 

### Features

* 4 digital instruments (sine wave, square wave, saw wave and drum kit) which can all be played through the website
* The user can play the instruments and playback the audio 
* The user can clear the audio and start over

### Installation Prerequisites & Dependencies

* VSCode or an equivalent editor/IDE that supports Python, web languages, and a terminal
* Python (downloaded as per the instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
* The following Python modules which can be installed via `pip install`:
  * Flask
  * Flask-Session
  * ffmpeg-python
  * Numpy
  * PyAudio
  * Pydub
  * Wave


### How to Install

* Download this folder to your machine, right click it and select "Extract All" 
* Using VSCode for browser can bring up problems with the dependencies, so we suggest using VSCode for desktop.
* Install Python and any of the above dependencies using `pip install dependency-name` as necessary.
* Once you've opened the folder in VSCode and have all the dependencies, enter 'python -m flask run' into the terminal
* The site should then run locally on your computer
* Follow the instructions in the 'about' page to receive guidance on how to interact with the platform

### How to Use

Here's how to use our platform!
* Click from the "Instruments" dropdown or one of the cards on the home page to select an instrument.
* Get creative! Play whatever notes or drum sounds you want and switch instruments at any time. 
* Use the PLAYBACK button to hear your work. 
* Use the CLEAR button to start over.
